An epigraph:

   Okay fellows, it's 10/23/94 - A Sunday, and I'm going to start writing the
   inventory program in QBasic. dBASE would probably be better in the long run
   but it would take too much time and my mamma needs this program quick. Aslo,
   I'm pretty good with QBasic and I believe that I can write a good inventory
   program in it. That's it.

And now onward.

Inventory 4 (Inv4), the fourth, and most likely final, major version of the
Elektrika inventory program that I started on that Sunday in 1994 and that has
helped this family company run for twenty-four years now--I write this on
6/26/18, a Tuesday, at 8:26 PM as the sky above the Jersey shoreline blazes with
the light of the hidden sun, set now below the horizon. The airy distances like
fire, contrails like lightning against the cerulean vault.

Characteristics of the system:

* Console application written in Java using the Lanterna library for screen I/O.

* A multi-user application running in a single JVM instance and accepting
clients through an unencrypted socket (TelnetTerminalServer) listener--for
security, users can ssh into the server and connect locally.

* The database will be an embedded object/key-value store, either JDBM2 or
BerkleyDB JE.

* Single-thread access to the DB, which is handled by a dedicated thread.

* Requests will be placed into a blocking queue and processed one-by-one.

* DB can be exported to a single ZIP file for backup. Periodic checkpointing
with rolling backups, like GPD.
